- ✅ Interactive controls and console output

**Known Issues:**
- ⚠️ Falsy value bugs (ID=0 treated as false)
- ⚠️ Manual getNodeId() workarounds needed everywhere
- ⚠️ No syntax highlighting in code editor
- ⚠️ Limited error messages (no line numbers)
- ⚠️ No step-by-step debugging

---

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Code Editor Enhancements

**Priority: HIGH**

**Problem:** Plain textarea with no syntax highlighting or line numbers

**Solutions:**
- Integrate Monaco Editor (VS Code's editor)
  - Syntax highlighting
  - Line numbers
  - Auto-completion
  - Error squiggles
  - Bracket matching
- Alternative: CodeMirror 6 (lighter weight)

**Implementation Effort:** Medium (2-3 hours)

**Example:**
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/monaco-editor@0.44.0/min/vs/loader.js"></script>
```

---

### 2. Enhanced Error Reporting

**Priority: HIGH**

**Problem:** Errors show "line X" but no context or highlighting

**Solutions:**
- Show error line in console with context
- Highlight error line in editor
- Add stack traces for runtime errors
- "Did you mean?" suggestions for typos

**Implementation Effort:** Medium (3-4 hours)

**Example Error:**
```
Line 15: Undefined variable: neigbors
    for neighbor in neigbors(current) {
                    ^^^^^^^^
Did you mean: neighbors?
```

---

### 3. Step-by-Step Debugger

**Priority: MEDIUM**

**Problem:** No way to pause execution and inspect state

**Solutions:**
- Add breakpoint support
- Step Over / Step Into / Continue buttons
- Variable inspector panel showing current values
- Call stack display

**Implementation Effort:** High (6-8 hours)

**UI Mockup:**
```
[▶ Run] [⏸ Pause] [⏭ Step] [⏹ Stop]
Current Line: 15
Variables: visited = {0, 1, 2}, current = 2
```

---

### 4. Algorithm Library System

**Priority: MEDIUM**

**Problem:** Only 4 hardcoded examples

**Solutions:**
- Save/Load custom algorithms to localStorage
- Import/Export as .netlang files

- Categories: Search, Shortest Path, MST, Flow, etc.

**Implementation Effort:** Medium (4-5 hours)

**Features:**
- "Save As..." dialog with name/description
- Algorithm browser with search
- One-click import from GitHub gist

---

### 5. Visual Algorithm Builder

**Priority: LOW**

**Problem:** Writing code is intimidating for beginners

**Solutions:**
- Blockly-style drag-and-drop interface
- Pre-built blocks for common operations
- Generates NetLang code automatically
- Side-by-side: blocks ↔ code

**Implementation Effort:** Very High (10+ hours)

**Example Blocks:**
```
[For each node in] [neighbors(current)]
  [If] [not visited]
    [Enqueue] [neighbor]
```

---

### 6. Graph Import/Export

**Priority: HIGH**

**Problem:** Can only manually build networks

**Solutions:**
- Import from formats: GraphML, DOT, JSON
- Export current network
- Load test graphs: small world, scale-free, grid
- Random graph generators with parameters

**Implementation Effort:** Medium (3-4 hours)

**Supported Formats:**
- JSON: `{"nodes": [...], "edges": [...]}`
- DOT: Graphviz format
- Adjacency matrix/list

---

### 7. Performance Metrics & Analytics

**Priority: MEDIUM**

**Problem:** No visibility into algorithm performance

**Solutions:**
- Execution time tracking
- Step counter (total operations)
- Memory usage (data structures)
- Comparison mode (run 2 algorithms side-by-side)

**Implementation Effort:** Low (2-3 hours)

**Output:**
```
BFS completed in 324ms
- 15 nodes visited
- 28 edges traversed
- 42 total operations
```

---

### 8. Better Visualization Options

**Priority: LOW**

**Problem:** Limited customization of visual output

**Solutions:**
- Speed controls (slow, normal, fast, instant)
- Replay mode (save execution, replay later)
- Export as animated GIF/video
- Dark/light themes
- Customizable colors per algorithm state

**Implementation Effort:** Medium (4-5 hours)

---

### 9. Multi-Graph Support

**Priority: LOW**

**Problem:** Can only work with one graph at a time

**Solutions:**
- Multiple graph tabs
- Split view for comparison
- Algorithm can create/modify secondary graphs
- Graph transformations (complement, transpose, etc.)

**Implementation Effort:** High (6-8 hours)

---

### 10. Advanced Data Structures

**Priority: MEDIUM**

**Problem:** Only basic collections (queue, set, map)

**Solutions:**
Add to NetLang:
- Priority queue (already stubbed, needs implementation)
- Stack
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
- Heap
- Tree structures

**Implementation Effort:** Medium (3-4 hours per structure)

---

## TypeScript Migration Analysis

### Current JavaScript Falsy Value Issues

**The Problem:**
```javascript
// Bug: ID=0 is treated as falsy
const id = node.id || node;  // Returns node when ID is 0!

// Correct but verbose:
const id = node.id !== undefined ? node.id : node;
```

**Occurrences in Current Codebase:**
- `dashboard.html`: ~15 instances of `(node.id || node)`
- Fixed manually with `getNodeId()` helper
- Easy to forget when adding new features
- Runtime errors are confusing

---

### TypeScript Benefits

#### 1. Compile-Time Type Safety

**Before (JavaScript):**
```javascript
function highlightNode(id, color) {
    // id could be number, string, object, undefined...
    // No way to know without runtime checks
}
```

**After (TypeScript):**
```typescript
interface Node {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    x?: number;
    y?: number;
}

function highlightNode(id: number, color: string): void {
    // Compiler guarantees id is a number
    // No falsy value bugs possible!
}
```

#### 2. Prevents Falsy Bugs Automatically

**TypeScript Solution:**
```typescript
// TypeScript forces explicit handling
const getNodeId = (node: Node | number): number => {
    return typeof node === 'number' ? node : node.id;
};

// Compiler error if you try the buggy version:
const id = node.id || node;  // ❌ Type error!
```

#### 3. Better IDE Support

- Auto-completion for all functions
- Hover tooltips with documentation
- Instant error highlighting
- Refactoring support (rename symbol)

#### 4. Self-Documenting Code

**Before:**
```javascript
function neighbors(id) { ... }  // What type is id?
```

**After:**
```typescript
function neighbors(nodeId: number): number[] {
    // Returns array of neighbor IDs
}
```

### TypeScript Migration Cost

**Effort Estimate:**

| File | Lines | Migration Effort | Time |
|------|-------|------------------|------|
| `netlang.js` | 1,126 | High (add types to interpreter) | 6-8h |
| `dashboard.html` | 1,200 | Medium (extract to .ts file) | 4-6h |
| **Total** | 2,326 | | **10-14h** |

**Migration Strategy:**

1. **Phase 1 (2h):** Set up TypeScript build system
   - Install TypeScript compiler
   - Add tsconfig.json
   - Set up build script

2. **Phase 2 (4-6h):** Migrate `netlang.js`
   - Define AST node interfaces
   - Type the interpreter
   - Add generics for Environment<T>

3. **Phase 3 (4-6h):** Migrate dashboard code
   - Extract JavaScript to separate .ts file
   - Define D3 types
   - Type graph API

4. **Phase 4 (2h):** Testing & debugging
   - Fix type errors
   - Verify no regressions
   - Update build process

**Pros:**
- ✅ Eliminates entire class of bugs (falsy values)
- ✅ Better development experience
- ✅ Easier to maintain and extend
- ✅ Catches errors before runtime
- ✅ Modern best practice

**Cons:**
- ❌ Initial migration time investment
- ❌ Build step required (compile TS → JS)
- ❌ Learning curve for TypeScript syntax
- ❌ Slightly more verbose code

---

### Recommendation: **YES, migrate to TypeScript**

**Rationale:**
1. The falsy value bugs have appeared 3+ times already
2. Codebase is small enough to migrate in ~2 days
3. Future development will be faster and safer
4. You're already familiar with type systems (Zig!)
5. TypeScript is industry standard for serious JS projects

**Alternative: Keep JavaScript with strict linting**
- Use ESLint with strict rules
- Add JSDoc type annotations
- Benefit: No build step
- Downside: Not enforced, easy to ignore
